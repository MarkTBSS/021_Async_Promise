```
When to Use Promises:

When you need to handle asynchronous operations in a clean and manageable way.
When you want to avoid callback hell.
When you need better error handling for asynchronous code.
When you need to chain multiple asynchronous operations.
When you want to run multiple asynchronous operations concurrently and wait for all of them to complete.

Promises are a powerful tool for managing asynchronous code in JavaScript, improving code readability, maintainability, and error handling.
